Most are brief, interim versions of final    reports and may contain undefined abbreviations or jargon. In addition, while    a report typically addressed a particular clinical development program, it    was insufficient, alone, to make an investment decision. Additional work,    including my conversations with clinical researchers, company management and    others provided supplementary information to support or refute the initial    thesis. The PM also evaluated each company's financial status, certain market    projections and relevant assumptions, as necessary.

On July 22, 2005, the FDA issued Adolor an &quot;approvable&quot; letter for alvimopan in post-operative ileus (POI). On November 6, 2006, the FDA issued Adolor a second &quot;approvable&quot; letter for alvimopan in POI. On January 23, 2008, an FDA advisory panel voted 9 to 6 acknowledging the clinical utility of alvimopan in POI. On May 20, 2008, the FDA cleared Entereg (alvimopan) to treat POI. In the first quarter of 2009, Adolor reported net sales for alvimopan of $1.4 million. In late June 2009, Adolor had a market capitalization of roughly $80 million with $125 million in cash and equivalents (no debt) at March quarter end.</p>	
      <p>In December 2011, Cubist Pharmaceuticals acquired Adolor for about $190 million cash plus up to $225 million in the form of a non-traded contingent value right, dependent on US and European regulatory approvals for ADL5945. By June 2015, Cubist had terminated all three phase 3 clinical trials of ADL5945 due to poor enrollment. Adolor’s final 10-Q filing with the SEC for September 2011 reported $23 million of cash and equivalents, nine-month year-to-date Entereg sales of $23.5 million and an accumulated deficit since its inception in 1993 of $530 million.</p>		  </div>

Ending Q2/05 with over $95 million   in cash and equivalents but sporting a market capitalization in early   August of »   $75 million, the Company entered into a reverse merger with privately   held AlgoRx, a company developing pain medications. Post merger, Corgentech's   investors owned roughly 40% of the new entity, called Anesiva (ANSV).   By April 2009, Anesiva had a market capitalization of about $12 million   and, in early August, announced that it was merging with privately held   Arcion Therapeutics.

In March 2006, an FDA advisory panel voted 9-0 in favor of expanding Cubicin's use to bacteremia (9-0), but only 5-4 for its use in endocarditis (a more valuable indication). That May, the FDA expanded the label to include bacteremia and right-side endocarditis (a partial victory for Cubist). For fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008, Cubicin sales were $190-, $290- and $415 million respectively. In late June 2009, Cubist had a market capitalization of about $1.06 billion.

Soon thereafter, the Company withdrew the NDA. On November 26, 2004, the Company reported that Genasense missed its primary clinical endpoint in the phase 3 trial for second line multiple myeloma. GNTA stock closed that day at $1.27, giving the Company a market capitalization of just over $100 million. In December 2004, Genta announced &quot;encouraging&quot; results from the phase 3 trial of Genasense in CLL and, in late December, 2005, submitted an NDA for this indication. However, in September 2006, an FDA advisory Panel again voted 7-3 against the NDA and the FDA rejected the NDA in mid-December. In late June 2009, Genta had a market capitalization of about $7 million.   On August 2, 2012, after almost 25 years and an accumulated deficit of $1.26 billion dollars, Genta filed for bankruptcy protection under <span class="red11">Chapter 7</span>, liquidating the Company. </div>

                At the time of FourSquare's report, Imclone had a market capitalization of about $4.5 billion (stock at » $62) with $349 million in cash and equivalents. On Friday evening, December 28, 2001, Imclone announced that the FDA issued a (rare) &quot;refuse-to-file&quot; letter for the Erbitux BLA. On December 31, IMCL traded down 16 percent. Within a month the stock was off 75 percent from its mid-70s high of the prior two months. By January 2002, both the SEC and the DoJ were investigating the Company and by March, Bristol-Myers Squibb had revised the terms of its September 2001 partnership. Before the end of the second quarter, IMCL stock was trading in single digits. In October, CEO Sam Waksal, Ph.D., plead guilty to six of 13 counts, including insider trading. Around June 2003 Dr. Waksal began a maximum seven-year prison term. In February 2004, the FDA cleared Erbitux for colorectal cancer. In 2007, Erbitux posted world-wide revenues of $1.28 billion. In October 2008, Eli Lilly offered to (and did) acquire the 24 year-old Company for $6.5 billion in cash ($70.00 per share). Ironically, Lilly originally owned the rights to the Erbitux antibody when it acquired Hybritech for about $350 million in 1986.</div>

                <p>FourSquare's September 11, 2009 report highlighted Immunomedics' dramatic stock rise on August 27, due to a Press Release reporting promising, if limited, Ph 2b data for epratuzumab in moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus. The stock closed up $2.58, 61 percent, to a five-year high of $6.84 on significant volume. With 75.2 million shares outstanding at the time, Immunomedics had a market capitalization of about $515 million with $27.4 million of cash and equivalents. By October 20, the stock was back at $4.23. Thus, in less than eight weeks, a one-day 60 percent gain had decayed to a 38 percent loss. In early February 2010, IMMU hit a low of $2.94. The purpose of FourSquare's report was to provide an example of how, at investors' peril, a stock's dramatic rise can effectively ignore a company's past performance. In late March 2010, IMMU had a market capitalization of ~ $260 million, and, at December end, about $18.6 million in cash and equivalents and $5.3 million of auction rate securities.</p>
                <p>Founded in July 1982, the Company has no FDA-approved therapeutic products. In its 10-Q filing for fiscal Q3 (March 2015), Immunomedics reported last nine months diagnostic product sales of  $2.18 million compared with $2.43 million for the same period last year. The Company ended the quarter with $106 million of cash and equivalents, $96 million of debt and an accumulated deficit of $297 million. With a mid-July stock price of $4.08, the Company had a market capitalization of $381 million.</p></div>

               <p>All three of MannKind's pivotal trials began when projected, except '009, which began in March 2006, several months ahead of schedule. Although the FDA had cleared Pfizer/Nektar's Exubera in late January 2006, the product was not launched until July 2006 due to manufacturing problems. Fifteen months later (October 2007), Pfizer announced that it would take a $2.8 billion charge against Exubera and that it had stopped marketing the product "...because it did not meet customers' needs or the company's financial expectations." In mid-April 2008, Pfizer added a warning to Exubera's Package Insert noting that continued monitoring of clinical trial patients had revealed six reported cases of non small-cell lung cancer from 4,740 patients on Exubera compared to one case from 4,292 control patients. All seven patients were smokers. The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.08). Still, MannKind halted its search for a marketing partner as the stock traded to a low near $2.00. On March 16, 2009, MannKind submitted its NDA for Afresa (FKA TI, inhaled insulin), resulting in a nominal PDUFA date in mid-January 2010. On January 8, the Company announced that the FDA would not issue a decision by the PDUFA date but only needed to complete the inspection of an insulin manufacturer. Also, the drug's trade name was changed to Afrezza. As of February 2, with FDA's decision still pending, MannKind stock traded at $9.60 with 113 million shares outstanding, yielding a market capitalization of $1.08 billion.</p>
               <p>Founded in February 1991 by the widely respected entrepreneur, Alfred Mann, the Company’s lead product, Afrezza (inhalational insulin), was FDA approved in June 2014. Less than two months later, MannKind partnered Afrezza with Sanofi for worldwide rights. The Company 10-Q for March 2015 did not report any product revenues; however, there were $7.1 million in Afrezza product sales to Sanofi, which were recorded as deferred product sales from collaboration. There was $121 million of cash and equivalents, $222 million of debt and an accumulated deficit of $2.53 billion. With a mid-July stock price of $5.49, MannKind had a market capitalization of $2.25 billion.</p></div>

On March 3, 2010, the Company announced disappointing results from the pivotal phase 3 CONNECTION trial of dimebon (latrepirdine). MDVN stock closed down $27.15 (67%) to $13.10 (» $440 million market capitalization based on 33.5 million shares outstanding) with 44.9 million shares traded and ended the third quarter with $214 million in cash and equivalents. Compared with placebo, the drug missed both its co-primary (ADAS-cog, p=0.86 and CIBIC-plus, p=0.81) and secondary (ADCS-ADL, p=0.61; NPI, p=0.17) clinical efficacy endpoints. In a separate phase 3 study designed to expand the safety database for dimebon, the drug was well tolerated both alone and in combination with several other Alzheimer's medicines. There were no unexpected adverse events reported for dimebon from either trial.</p>
               <p>In June 2005, the Company established Medivation Prostate Therapeutics as a wholly owned subsidiary and, in June, licensed the rights to enzalutamide. In August 2012, the FDA approved the drug, trade-named Xtandi, as second-line therapy for (metastatic, castration-resistant) prostate cancer. Roughly two years later, Xtandi’s label was expanded to include first-line use (i.e., prior to chemotherapy), putting it on par with J&J’s first-to-market Zytiga. Despite a low risk for seizures, Xtandi sales of more than $1.0 billion are expected for 2015. Based on Medivation’s 10-Q for March 2015, the Company had $569 million of cash and equivalents, $245 million of debt and last twelve months net income of $287 million on revenues of $752 million. At $147.25 in mid-July 2015 stock price of $112.92, Medivation had a market capitalization of  $8.9 billion.</p>

Based on Thoratec’s 10-Q for March 2015, the Company had $240 million of cash and equivalents, no debt and last twelve months net income of $42.9 million on revenues of $473 million. At $46.61 in mid-July 2015, Thoratec had a market capitalization of $2.5 billion. The ratio of enterprise value to last twelve months revenues is 4.8, compared with Abiomed’s 11.6 ratio. On July 21, 2015, St. Jude Medical offered to acquire Thoratec for $3.4 billion in cash, paying $63.50 per share, a 30 percent premium over the $48.81 pre-news price.</p></div>

                <p>At the time of FourSquare's report, Theravance's stock traded around $20.64 with 53.4 million shares outstanding, including Glaxo's 9.4 million shares (» 18 percent). This gave the Company a market capitalization of about $1.1 billion with $202 million in cash and equivalents. Numerically, little has changed over the past four years. However, in August 2006, the Company reported modest results from two Phase 3 trials of its telavancin antibiotic in skin and soft tissue infections. In June 2007, long-time partner, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), chose not to exercise its call option for 50 percent of the outstanding stock. That September both GSK and Astellas chose not to exercise their options for two of Theravance's drugs in development. Despite a favorable FDA panel review of telavancin in November 2008, kidney toxicity problems worried FDA officials, prompting an &quot;approvable&quot; letter this past February. Theravance responded to the FDA's questions in April and expects a decision in mid-September. A second decision from the FDA regarding telavancin's use in hospital-acquired pneumonia is expected in late November. In early August 2009 with the stock at » $15, Theravance had a market capitalization of about $940 million, ending the second quarter with $176 million in cash and equivalents plus $173 million held as convertible debt.</p>
                <p>With over 200 full-time employees at the end of 2011, Theravance had shrunk to 12 employees as of December 2014 and currently describes itself as a “royalty management company.” Based on the Company’s 10-Q for March 2015, Theravance had $251 million in cash and equivalents, $732 million of debt and last twelve months revenues of $16.1 million. At $16.59 in mid-July 2015, the Company had a market capitalization of $1.9 billion. It is also worth noting that there were 26.6 million shares short (over 80 percent of the float) representing 46 days of trading volume. </p></div>

                <p>At the time of FourSquare's report, Trimeris's stock was quoted at $45.14, giving the Company a market capitalization of about $845 million with $115 million in cash and equivalents. In April 2002, Trimeris reported impressive results from the first of two Phase 3 trials for Fuzeon in very advanced AIDS patients. Solid results were also reported a month later for the second trial. In February 2003, Trimeris's partner, Hoffmann-La Roche, announced that it planned to sell Fuzeon in Europe for about $20,000 a year, much higher than any other AIDS therapies. That March, the FDA cleared Fuzeon (an injectable drug) after a six-month review. World-wide sales in 2004 were $135 million, peaked at $267 million in 2007 and have been dropping each year due to newer oral AIDS medications. Half through 2009, sales were running at an annualized rate of » $115 million. In early August 2009 with the stock at $2.29, Trimeris had a market capitalization of about $51 million and ended the second quarter with $33 million in cash and equivalents. Trimeris currently has four full-time employees.</p>
                <p>In November 2011, Trimeris reverse-merged into privately held Synageva, leaving Trimeris shareholders owning 25 percent of the combined company. In May 2015, Alexion Pharmaceuticals acquired Synageva for $8.4 billion (50/50 cash and stock). Many on Wall Street considered this a high price. Based on the Company’s 10-Q for March 2015, Synageva had $711 million in cash and equivalents, no debt and no product revenues. The FDA has set September 8, 2015 as the PDUFA date for Synageva’s Kanuma (sebelipase alpha), an enzyme replacement therapy to treat lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL).  LAL affects perhaps 3,000 individuals worldwide.  </p></div>
